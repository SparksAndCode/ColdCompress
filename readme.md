# Cold Compress Project

## Idea
Make my wife a mask that stays cooler longer than her current solution to help with her migraines.

## Plan
Insulated water tank and ice as cold source. Small water pump that is PID driven to drive the mask temp down to programmed temp. Make whole thing run off a M12 battery for portability. 

## Research
1. Mask Material
    * Consider thermal conductivity of mask. 
    * Could we cast the mask out of metal (alum or pewter)? 
    * How thermal conductive is PETG/PLA? 
    * Electroplate the mask with copper with thermal pipes?
      * Prob need a resin printer for that. 
    * Will metal be too cold?
    * Will plastic never get cold?
2. Passive Solution
    * Is it possible to make the whole thing passive. Use convection to pull heat from face.
    * Use genetic algo to find best shape for dissipating heat via convection. (OpenFOAM)
3. GA Internal Channels
    * Use genetic algo to find best channel size for best heat dissipation. (OpenFOAM)

## Notes
* 3d Printing Water Tight Models
  * 1.05 Extruder Multiplier
  * 4-5 Wall Count
  * 5 degree hotter on filament temp
  * watch for single walls
